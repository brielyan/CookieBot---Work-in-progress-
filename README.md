# 🍪 Cookie Clicker Bot

**dont forget to check the releases**

A small automation project built with **Python + Selenium** to experiment with browser automation and game interaction.

This bot is still **under active development** and may present bugs or unfinished features. The goal of the project is learning, testing ideas, and exploring how automation behaves in real-world websites.

---

## 🚀 What this bot does

* Automatically clicks the **big cookie**
* Buys **buildings** when enough cookies are available
* Detects available items dynamically (no hardcoded limits)
* Uses a browser setup that **does not break or block the CAPTCHA**

⚠️ The CAPTCHA must still be solved **manually after did once will do automatically**, but the bot **does not enter loops or reset**, which is the main focus of this project.

---

## ❌ What is NOT working (yet)

* Automatic upgrade purchasing (logic is implemented but unreliable)
* Full automation without manual interaction
* Error handling for long unattended sessions

These parts are being actively improved.

---

## ⚙️ Customizable behavior

Several parts of the code are easy to adjust:

* How long the bot runs
* Click speed and loop size
* Purchase logic for items

This makes the project flexible for testing and learning purposes.

## 📌 Important notes

* This project is **for educational purposes only**
* Cookie Clicker mechanics or site changes may break the bot
* Selenium behavior may vary between browser versions
